# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-using-cpp
<br><br>
This project implements a classical computer visionâ€“based recognition system that combines detection, feature extraction, and statistical similarity measures to compare visual patterns. The pipeline begins with Haar Cascade Classifiers for object/face detection, followed by Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for texture-based feature extraction. The extracted features are transformed into a histogram representation, which is then normalized to ensure scale-invariant comparison. Finally, the system applies the Chi-Square distance metric to evaluate similarity between two normalized histograms. This approach provides a lightweight yet effective alternative to deep learning methods, making it suitable for real-time applications where computational efficiency is critical.
